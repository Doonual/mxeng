#include "Lab 4/Robot Task 1.c"

// When compiling the project, the compiler will ignore all of the c files stored in Lab 2, Lab 3 and so on.
// This is necessary as you cannot have multiple int main() functions in one project, because then you wont know where to start
// To get around this we just have the one Robot.c which will #include whatever file we want to start in
// The #include is exactly the same as copying the included file and pasting it here.
// This makes it possible to have code from multiple labs / tasks in the same project without needing to comment an entire file out
